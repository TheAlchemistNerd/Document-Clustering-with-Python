# Document-Clustering-with-Python
An end to end project to cluster BBC news articles
I have written an RSS feed reader for the various news categories from bbc
I then use clean the data and carry out feature extraction.
I run the K-Means of Clustering on the cleaned data, create a word cloud andpredict clustersfor new documents basedon the created model
